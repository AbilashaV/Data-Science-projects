## About Me

Hi, Hello !! I am Abilasha (Abi). Welcome to my Portfolio!!

I have technical background and hold a Master of Science degree in Supply Chain Management from National University Singapore (NUS). I have 7+ years of experience in Supply Chain & Data Analysis.  I have handled large datasets, various ETL tools written SQL queries,designed Tableau dashbords.  I am proficient in Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, Alteryx and have a solid understanding of data analytics techniques such as dashboard building, report writing, data mining, data merging, data cleaning, statistics, and critical thinking.

Over all these years I have created many interactive supply chain control tower dashboards in Tableau. I love creating vizzes which are simple and interactive for customer needs.

Through my own interest learnt Data Science through various courses and projects and comfortable working with Python and doing EDA & prediction from any datasets. 

#### This repository serves to showcase of my skills, a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.

In addition to my technical skills, I am confident on my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I am able to approach data analysis with a strategic mindset, and to identify key issues and opportunities in the data for any business questions/needs.
